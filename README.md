# Horama

From the ancient greek word ὅραμα meaning "that which is seen, visible object, sight", Horama is a web app that lets its users search for movies, see their details and leave reviews! You can find it currently deployed online at: https://horama.netlify.app/

The frontend is deployed on Netlify and the backend is deployed on Heroku.

This project was done as way to learn Javascript and related technologies such as as React, Node, Express, and construction and manipulation of databases.
For this reason, there may be a few bugs. If you find any, make sure to contact me! 

## Disclaimer:

Some features exist for the sole purpose of allowing me to implement a certain concept I found important (e.g. the Welcome page where one can insert their name does not serve a practical purpose. It was only a way for me to use the useContext hook).
